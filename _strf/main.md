* [Fig. 4.3: Spatio-temporal evolution of the covariance between a reference point (in blue) and the rest of the points in the domain, for the spatio-temporal model simulated in Fig 4.1. The color (red to blue) represent the value of the covariance.](../STRF/adv-diff-sphere-cov)  


* [Fig. 5.1: Spatio-temporal kriging predictor from data sampled from a simulation of the SPDE model and with a  measurement noise of standard-deviation $\sigma=0.1$. The blue points locate the places where the observations are taken. ](../STRF/krig)
