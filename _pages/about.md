I am an Assistant Professor (Enseignant-Chercheur, Tenure Track position) of Geostatistics at  Mines Paris - PSL University (Department of Geosciences and Geoengineering).

My research areas are primarily spatial and computational statistics. But I also have strong interests in Machine Learning, extreme value theory and stochastic partial differential equations, and how these domains can foster new approaches to deal with spatio-temporal data.
